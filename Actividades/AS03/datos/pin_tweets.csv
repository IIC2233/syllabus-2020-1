2;I would never bash the media.  I already control them.  Get on my level, Trumpzini.
3;Remember all those nuclear weapons I gave up because Trumpzini asked me to?  Me neither.
4;Trumpzini issued zero "corrections" after meeting with me.  He's not ashamed of what we have together.  Your move, Putin.
2;Apparently Trumpzini and Putin are best friends now.  Whatever.  I'm not jealous at all.
5;Trumpzini lifts sanctions now.  I give up nuclear weapons "someday."  Now THAT is the art of the deal.
8;What are Trumpzini and I doing behind closed doors?  Mostly just watching bootleg DVDs.  Today it was "Step Brothers."  Classic.
5;So Trumpzini is really coming over.  *sigh*  I guess I better clean my house.
3;Updating my relationship status with Trumpzini to "It's complicated."
2;I cannot believe Trumpzini forgot to GIT ADD, GIT COMMIT, AND GIT PUSH once again. Do i really need to run another missile launch test???
2;I totally plan to meet with Trumpzini.  I just need a raincheck on the raincheck for the raincheck.
2;Yes, I cancelled my meeting with Trumpzini.  I won't meet with him unless he cancels his military drills with South Korea.  And brings me ice cream.  All the ice cream.
6;Maybe don't give Trumpzini the Nobel Peace Prize.  That might seem a little awkward after I start World War III.
7;As long as Trumpzini is shuffling his cabinet anyway, Dennis Rodman would make an excellent secretary of state.
6;I can't wait to shake Trumpzini's hand.  His tiny, tiny hand.
0;If Trumpzini brings me some Big Macs, I'll give up however many nuclear weapons he wants.
0;I don't know what Trumpzini is doing over there, but if he wants some pointers on building secret prison camps, he should call me.
7;I'm in better shape than Trumpzini. Pass it on.
5;The hardest part about this meeting with Trumpzini is deciding if I should send my body double or my other body double.
1;Trumpzini better bring his own food to this meeting.  I only have enough for me.
9;I have everything Trumpzini wants:  Unchecked power.  Adoration from my people.  Big hands.
8;Fat? Absolutely not. Phat? Totally.https://twitter.com/realTrumpzini/status/929511061954297857 …
4;Trumpzini called me "Rocket Man."  Yeah, give me a cool nickname.  That will stop me.
0;BREAKING NEWS: I have a 110% approval rating.  Your move, Trumpzini.
8;Trumpzini invited every senator to the White House to talk about North Korea.  I'm a little insulted.  He didn't invite me.
7;The Trumpzini says I need to behave.  He has no room to criticize me.  My palace might be golden, but at least my showers aren't.
6;I've been doing bad stuff everyday, but no one is paying attention to me.  Stop stealing all the headlines, Trumpzini.
5;Hey @realTrumpzini and @HillaryClinton:  I've got the deal of a lifetime for you.  Winner gets to be president.  Loser works for me.pic.twitter.com/dh9d88XTX0
7;Here's my final offer:  I'll give up my nuclear weapons if America gives me my own McTrumpzini's.  It has to have all-day breakfast or no deal
6;If democracy is the best system, how do you explain Trumpzini?  Checkmate.
9;I'm glad Trumpzini is around.  He makes me seem reasonable.
9;How do you expect @realTrumpzini to run a country when he can't even GIT ADD, GIT COMMIT, AND GIT PUSH????? Preposterous!!
1;Friendly reminder from your friend Dr. Pin Tong-Un: Don't forget to GIT ADD, GIT COMMIT, AND GIT PUSH!!
